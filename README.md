### Welcome to my music blog project!
This web application is a tribute to my favorite music website, All Music, and currently lets you browse Discogs releases on a home page with individual detail pages for each entry. It aims to replicate its core features using classic web technologies and the Discogs API.

### Planned Features
Music Library: Browse a growing collection of music releases (albums, EPs, and singles) sourced from the Discogs API. Each entry on the home page links to a dedicated detail page with more information.\
Reviews: Read and write reviews for your favorite albums and tracks.\
Commentary Sections: Engage in discussions and share your thoughts with other music enthusiasts.\
Rating Functionality: Rate albums and tracks to share your opinion with the community.\

### Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the web pages.\
CSS: For styling the application and making it visually appealing.\
SASS: For more efficient and manageable CSS.\
JavaScript: For adding interactivity and handling user actions.\
JSON: For data interchange format, particularly in communication with the Discogs API.\
Discogs API: To fetch detailed music data and enrich the library.

### Getting Started
Prerequisites\
To run this project, you need a modern web browser and an internet connection.

### Current Progress
Home Page\
The home page now displays multiple entries fetched from the Discogs API and serves as the starting point for exploring the music library.\
Post Pages\
Each entry on the home page links to its own post page, which shows more detailed information about the selected release.

### Future Goals
Refine the home page design to make it even more user-friendly and visually appealing.\
Expand the music library by adding more filtering, sorting, and search options on top of the Discogs API data.\
Add Review System: Allow users to read and write reviews for albums and tracks.\
Enable Commentary Sections: Create sections for user discussions and comments.\
Integrate Rating Functionality: Develop a system for users to rate albums and tracks.\
